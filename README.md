# UI-UX-Tutorial
I followed along a tutorial for creating a modern UI page. The main purpose of this project was to gain familiarity with React.


The tutorial was provided by YouTube channel: JavaScript Mastery. A large portion of the jobs I see open prefer React experience, so I followed along this tutorial so I can get my feet wet utilizing React as well as solidifying common Javascript concepts.
